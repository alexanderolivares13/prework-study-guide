    The purpose of the project was to learn how to structure a webpage using HTML. To learn how to style it using CSS, and to build simple functions and for loops using JavaScript.

- What problem does it solve?
    The project gave was able to give me a concrete goal to work towards, and serves as a study guide for notes and important details that I can reference back to on the subjects I learned. I will be able to look back on this project one day and compare how my vast knowledge has increased throughout the course of the bootcamp.

- What did you learn?
    I learned how to approach problem solving and debugging as a developer. As well as, the importance of repitition and building better habits when commiting and pushing changes to git, so that I may avoid falling into common mistakes, but ultimately I learned that there is a vast number of factors that go into programming that are inevitable. So building a developers mindset and learning how to tackle any issues that might arise, no matter how big or small, is the most important skill to learn.
